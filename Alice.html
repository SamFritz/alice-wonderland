	<div class="Chapter1" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h2><p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, <span class="q">"and what is the use of a book,"</span> thought Alice, <span class="q">"without pictures or conversations?"</span></p><p>So she was considering, in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. </p><p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so <span style="font-style: italic">very</span> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself <span class="q">"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!"</span> (when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but, when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of it waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it</p><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28e244">[Page 7]</div><p>flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p><p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considered how in the world she was to get out again. </p><p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.</p><p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed: it was labeled <span style="font-style: italic">“ORANGE MARMALADE,”</span> but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p><p><span class="q">"Well!"</span> thought Alice to herself. <span class="q">"After such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down-stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell of the top of the house!"</span>(Which was very likely true.)</p><p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <span style="font-style: italic">never</span> come to an end? <span class="q">"I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?"</span> she said aloud. <span class="q">"I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—"</span> (for, you see, Alice had learnt several thinks of this sort in her lessons in the school-room, and although this was not a <span style="font-style: italic">very</span> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) <span class="q">"—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve go to?"</span> (Alice had not the slightest idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say.)</p><p>Presently she began again. <span class="q">"I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards! The antipathies, I think—"</span> (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) <span class="q">"—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New"</span></p><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28e288">[Page 8]</div><p><span class="q">"Zealand? Or Australia?"</span>(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy,<span style="font-style: italic">curtseying</span> as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) <span class="q">"And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! Not, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere."</span></p><p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. <span class="q">"Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!"</span> (Dinah was the cat.<span id="Note3_return"><a class="notelink" title="Dinah was also the name of the Liddell’s cat, named, with her companion Villikens, after the character in a popular mid century dialect ballad" href="#Note3"><sup>3</sup></a></span>) <span class="q">"I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’, afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?"</span> And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy fort of way, <span class="q">"Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?"</span> and sometimes <span class="q">"Do bats eat cats?"</span> for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and was saying to her, very earnestly, <span class="q">"Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?"</span> when suddenly, thump! Thump! Down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p><p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead: before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, <span class="q">"Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!"</span> She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p><p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. </p><p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass: there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first idea was that his might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen </p><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28e328">[Page 9]</div><p>inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p><div class="figure floatimage" id="fig03"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7362321/4341261/3e286ac2-4037-11e4-8e08-757e8b46e5c6.png" alt="Alice (Tenniel, 1865, 04)" class="graphic" /><div class="caption">Figure 3. Alice (Tenniel, 1865, 04)</div></div><p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not event get her head through the doorway; <span class="q">"and even if my head <span style="font-style: italic">would</span> go thought,"</span> thought poor Alice, <span class="q">"“it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin."</span> For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.</p><p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it (<span class="q">"which certainly was not here before,"</span> said Alice), and tied around the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words <span style="font-style: italic">“DRINK ME”</span> beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p><p>It was all very well to say <span style="font-style: italic">“Drink me,”</span> but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. <span class="q">"No, I’ll look first,"</span> she said, <span class="q">"“and see whether it’s marked <span style="font-style: italic">‘poison’</span> or not"</span>; for she had read several nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught</p><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28e369">[Page 10]</div><p>them:<span id="Note4_return"><a class="notelink" title="This reference is a traditional kind of children’s story, popular in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries but beginning to seem old-fashioned by the time Dodgson told the Alice stories, in which clear lessons of obedience and prudence were enforced by visiting terrible calamities upon children who transgressed. Dodgson placed asterisks after the paragraphs in which Alice drinks the contents of…" href="#Note4"><sup>4</sup></a></span> such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that, if you cut your finger <span style="font-style: italic">very</span> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p><p>However, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off. </p><p><span class="q">"What a curious feeling!"</span> said Alice. <span class="q">"I must be shutting up like a telescope!"</span> And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, how-</p><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28e387">[Page 11]</div><p>ever, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; <span class="q">"for it might end, you know,"</span> said Alice to herself, <span class="q">"in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?"</span> And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p><p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through, the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p><p><span class="q">"Come, there’s no use in crying like that!"</span> said Alice to herself rather sharply. <span class="q">"I advise you to leave off this minute!"</span> She general gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eye; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. <span class="q">"But it’s no use now,"</span> thought poor Alice, <span class="q">"to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make <span style="font-style: italic">one</span> respectable person!"</span></p><p>Soon her eyes fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words <span style="font-style: italic">“EAT ME”</span> were beautifully marked in currants. <span class="q">"Well, I’ll eat it,"</span> said Alice, <span class="q">"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!"</span></p><p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself <span class="q">"Which way? Which way?"</span>, holding her hand on the top of her head to heel which way it was growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. To be sure, this is what generally happened when on eats cake; but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way</p><p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d28e431">[Page 12]</div></div><div class="References" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">References</span></h2><div class="lg"><div class="l">About TEI Boilerplate.
